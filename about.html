        <h2>About Tic Tac Realm</h2>
        <div class="prose">
            <h3>A Modern Classic, Reimagined</h3><p>Welcome to Tic Tac Realm, where a timeless game meets modern design and intelligent gameplay. We believe that even the simplest games deserve a beautiful, thoughtful execution. Our goal was to create more than just a Tic Tac Toe board; we wanted to build an experience. An experience that is clean, fast, responsive, and a genuine pleasure to interact with, whether you're challenging our advanced AI or a friend sitting next to you.</p><h3>What is Tic Tac Toe?</h3><p>Tic Tac Toe (also known as Noughts and Crosses or Xs and Os) is a paper-and-pencil game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X and O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. It is a solved game, with a forced draw assuming best play from both players.</p><h3>Features of the Realm</h3><p>We've packed Tic Tac Realm with features to provide a premium, comprehensive gameplay experience, all completely free.</p><ul><li><strong>Unbeatable AI Opponent:</strong> Our 1-Player mode isn't just a random move generator. It's powered by the Minimax algorithm, a decision-making AI that looks ahead to find the optimal move. It will never make a mistake. Can you force a draw against a perfect opponent?</li><li><strong>Seamless 2-Player Mode:</strong> Challenge a friend or family member with our clean and intuitive 2-Player mode. Pass the device and enjoy a classic showdown.</li><li><strong>Level Progression:</strong> In AI mode, your level is saved as you play. Challenge yourself to see how high you can get!</li><li><strong>Strategic Ad Breaks:</strong> To keep this platform free, we are supported by ads. We have carefully integrated "Ad Breaks" that can appear after a certain number of levels or when using special features, ensuring they occur at natural pauses in gameplay and don't interrupt the action.</li><li><strong>Polished, Responsive Design:</strong> Our neon style is designed to be elegant and readable on any device, from a large desktop monitor to your mobile phone on the go. Every animation, every color, and every font was chosen to create a fun and engaging atmosphere.</li><li><strong>Clear Visual Feedback:</strong> Watch the 'X' and 'O' symbols animate into place. When a player wins, a line is satisfyingly drawn through the winning combination, leaving no doubt about the outcome.</li></ul><h3>Our Philosophy and Commitment</h3><p>Tic Tac Realm was created by a small team passionate about web development and quality gaming. We are committed to maintaining a high-quality, free-to-play platform. The advertisements on our site are what enable us to cover our operational costs. We are dedicated to ensuring these ads are as non-intrusive as possible. Your privacy is paramount, and we have outlined our data practices in a comprehensive, human-readable Privacy Policy. We believe in transparency and providing you with a safe, fun environment. Thank you for visiting Tic Tac Realm. We hope you have a wonderful time playing.</p>
